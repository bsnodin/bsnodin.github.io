_This is a simplified, “strong opinion, weakly held” take on how to create a self-sustaining field, having completed a project aiming to shed light on this question (see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/research_articles/investigating_how_technology)). I don’t necessarily have high confidence in the assertions made here._

Academic research happens when government funding is given to academic researchers.[^1]

As grant applicants, academic researchers have a fair amount of leeway to determine what work gets funded, since how funding gets allocated depends on the strength of the various grant applications, and since researchers often deviate significantly from the work they said they’d do in their grant applications.

Meanwhile, although direction from government decision makers is important, the academic researchers who sit on research councils have a lot of influence on which projects receive government funding.

So, as a group, academic researchers have a surprising amount of control over what gets funded.

This, together with the findings about the importance of different factors from [this project]({{ site.baseurl }}/research_articles/investigating_how_technology), suggests the following recipe for creating a self-sustaining technology-focused academic field:

* Convince researchers that there are relatively easy, high impact publications to be had, by showing practical progress:
  * Develop prototypes.
  * Make practical devices / designs.
  * Make a splash with a high profile publication or an unexpectedly strong result.
* Engage with / appeal to the scientific mainstream, and avoid controversy.
* For “big” technological goals: convince governments of strategic importance.

The table below explains why various technology-focused academic fields became self-sustaining (or didn’t) according to the framework sketched above.

## Notes

[^1]:
     Private funding can of course play an important role, especially early on, but ultimately to create a self-sustaining field it’s much more important to convince government funders than to convince private funders, so I ignore private funding here.
