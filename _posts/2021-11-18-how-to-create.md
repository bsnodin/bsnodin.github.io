_This is a highly speculative, deliberately simplified, “strong opinion, weakly held” take on how to create a self-sustaining field, having completed a project aiming to shed light on the question “how do technology fields become self-sustaining” (see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/research_articles/investigating_how_technology)). I don’t necessarily have high confidence in any particular assertion made here._

How does academic research happen? It needs[^1]



* Government funding
* Given to academic researchers.

This suggests two angles for getting research to happen in the field of interest: convince government funders they want to fund it, or convince researchers they want to bid for funding to do it.



* Researchers (grant applicants) have a fair amount of leeway to determine what work gets funded
    * Usually how funding gets allocated depends on the strength of the various applications (not just their topics).
    * Researchers can and do deviate significantly from the work they said they’d do in their application.
* “Convince government funders they want to fund it” can mean convincing academics who e.g. sit on research councils -- these researchers have a lot of influence on what research happens.
* Still, “deliberate” government funding can play an important role.

So the recipe is:



* Convince researchers that there is low-hanging fruit (i.e. relatively easy, high impact publications).
* Do this by showing practical progress:
    * Develop prototypes.
    * Make practical devices / designs.
    * Make a splash with a high profile publication / an unexpectedly strong result.
* (maybe only for “big” technological goals) Convince governments of strategic importance.
* Engage with / appeal to the scientific mainstream, and avoid controversy.

Making roadmaps can be useful, but more so for steering the direction of the field than creating general growth of the field.

The table below explains why the 10 fields [we looked at]({{ site.baseurl }}/research_articles/investigating_how_technology) became self-sustaining (or didn’t) according to this framework.

   <td>Clean Meat
   </td>
   <td>It had a bit of government funding for many years (mostly thanks to Willem van Eelen).<strong> A push from Jason Matheny </strong>led to a high impact paper and a televised event which <strong>attracted public excitement</strong>, creating the conditions for <strong>more government funding</strong>.

  <tr>
   <td>Fusion Power
   </td>
   <td>It was <strong>obvious to researchers and governments that this was a promising area</strong>, following the success of fission power and fission and fusion-based weapons.

## Notes

[^1]:
     Private funding can of course play an important role, especially early on, but ultimately to create a self-sustaining field it’s much more important to convince government funders than to convince private funders, so I ignore private funding here.
