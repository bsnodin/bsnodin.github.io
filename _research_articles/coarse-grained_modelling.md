title: Coarse-grained modelling of the structural properties of DNA origami
type: Academic paper
journal: Nucleic Acids Research
date: 2019-01-03
abstract: We used oxDNA to characterise the detailed structural properties of DNA origami structures. For a particular orgami for which we have high quality experimental structural data, the model's fit was excellent (the rms deviation was similar to the experimental resolution).
