title: Coarse-grained modelling of the structural properties of DNA origami
type: Academic paper
journal: Nucleic Acids Research
date: 2019-01-03
abstract: We used a coarse-grained DNA model (oxDNA) to characterise the detailed structural properties of DNA origami structures. The model gave an excellent fit for a particular orgami for which we have high quality experimental structural data.
