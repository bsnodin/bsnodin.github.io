abstract: "We tracked the time evolution of 29 “factors” for 10 fields. The following factors tend to switch on in the run-up to field establishment: risk tolerant funding, high perceived impact, existence of practical designs, practical work, a high profile paper, and a sense of possibility. Meanwhile, the following factors seem not be necessary: a prestigious advocate, intuitive appeal, and strong government interest."
