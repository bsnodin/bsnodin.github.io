title: CoT May Be Highly Informative Despite “Unfaithfulness”

abstract: "Recent work demonstrates that LLMs’ chains of thought aren’t always “faithful”: they don’t contain an accurate representation of every cognitive step the LLM used to arrive at its answer. However, perfect faithfulness may be an unnecessarily high standard for practical safety analysis.

As a research engineer contracted with METR, I helped run experiments examining whether harmful reasoning patterns remain detectable despite chain-of-thought unfaithfulness."
