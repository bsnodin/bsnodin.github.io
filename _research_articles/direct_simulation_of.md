title: Direct Simulation of the Self-Assembly of a Small DNA Origami
type: Academic paper
journal: ACS Nano
date: 2016-01-01
abstract: We used a coarse-grained DNA model (oxDNA) to simulate the complete assembly of a small-scale DNA origami, finding evidence of kinetic traps and co-operativity between staple strands. The paper was highlighted in the "In Nano" article in that journal issue.
