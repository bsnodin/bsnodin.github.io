title: Forecasting AI Time Horizon Under Compute Slowdowns
type: Academic paper
journal: arXiv preprint
date: 2025-11-24
abstract: Given a model of time horizon as a function of training compute and algorithms, along with a model of how compute investment spills into algorithmic progress, and the empirical fact that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019-2025, we derive that time horizon growth must be proportional to compute growth.
