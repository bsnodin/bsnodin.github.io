Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ben. I'm a Senior Researcher at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), where my work focuses on the risks and opportunities from a potential future technology called atomically precise manufacturing.

I previously worked as a Senior Research Scholar at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and in finance as a quantitative analyst. Before then I completed a [PhD in DNA nanotechnology](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) at Oxford University. I also used to row a lot.

I'm into ["effective altruism"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and ["longtermism"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future/), and I've signed the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.
