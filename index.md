Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ben. I previously led the Existential Security team at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), worked on [nanotechnology strategy research](research_articles/thoughts_on_nanotechnology/) (resources database [here](https://www.bensnodin.com/research_articles/nanotech_resources_database/)), and co-founded [EA Pathfinder](https://www.successif.org/). Right now I'm taking time out to work out how to best contribute to AI safety efforts.

I've worked as a Senior Research Scholar at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and spent 5 years working in finance as a quantitative analyst. Before then I completed a [PhD in DNA nanotechnology](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) at Oxford University. I've signed the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.
