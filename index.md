Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ben. I'm a Senior Researcher at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), where my work focuses on the risks and opportunities from a potential future technology called atomically precise manufacturing.

I previously worked as a Senior Research Scholar at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and in finance as a quantitative analyst. Before then I completed a [PhD in DNA nanotechnology](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) at Oxford University. I also used to row a lot.

Iâ€™m also the co-founder of [EA Pathfinder](https://www.eapathfinder.org/), providing free 1-1 mentoring to mid-career professionals seeking fulfilling work in EA. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ea_pathfinder) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ea-pathfinder) for updates.

I'm into ["effective altruism"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and ["longtermism"](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future/), and I've signed the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.

You can reach me at hello[at]bensnodin dot com, and you can also leave [anonymous feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScelY3qOAAhKkTy3mSLgA896K9YEG1X-AdLfN_wgo-Tkt-e1Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) for me.
