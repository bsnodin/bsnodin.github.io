Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ben. I lead the [Existential Security team](https://rethinkpriorities.org/team) at [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), where our current focus is [helping launch entrepreneurial projects that reduce existential risk](https://rethinkpriorities.org/xst-incubation). See [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYSEjBsWbjNqioRZJ/the-rethink-priorities-existential-security-team-s-strategy) for a blog post describing our team strategy for 2023.

In 2022 I worked on [nanotechnology strategy research](research_articles/thoughts_on_nanotechnology/) and co-founded [EA Pathfinder](https://www.successif.org/), which I co-led from April to September 2022. You can see what the Existential Security team more broadly got up to in 2022 [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C26RHHYXzT6P6A4ht/what-rethink-priorities-general-longtermism-team-did-in-2022).

If you're interested in learning more about nanotechnology strategy research, you could check out [this database of resources](https://www.bensnodin.com/research_articles/nanotech_resources_database/) I made.

I previously worked as a Senior Research Scholar at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) and spent 5 years working in finance as a quantitative analyst. Before then I completed a [PhD in DNA nanotechnology](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Main_Page) at Oxford University.

I'm into [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and [longtermism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-long-run-future/), and I've signed the [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) pledge.
