Nanotechnology strategy research resources database
=================================================================================


Here is a database with descriptions and links to over 40 resources relevant for nanotechnology strategy research. For more information, see [this cover sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Lm8xEh3C4W1BaVac59z2qNXOQf_-axdUSp6WGYo4Ck/edit#). You can also view the database in a [grid format](https://airtable.com/shrEpirccT7MrdQHw/tbl0EH7sYdC8GHs5c). Many thanks to Marie Davidsen Buhl for her help with creating this database.

If you find this database useful and are interested in trying out work in nanotechnology strategy research, please feel free to reach out to me at hello [at] bensnodin dot com – I’ll likely be happy to help and might have updated notes or other resources.
