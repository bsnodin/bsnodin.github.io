Nanotechnology strategy research resources database
=================================================================================


Here is a database with descriptions and links to over 40 resources relevant for nanotechnology strategy research. For more information, see [this cover sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Lm8xEh3C4W1BaVac59z2qNXOQf_-axdUSp6WGYo4Ck/edit#). You can also view the database in a [grid format](https://airtable.com/shrEpirccT7MrdQHw/tbl0EH7sYdC8GHs5c). Many thanks to Marie Davidsen Buhl for her help with creating this database.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this database! If you find it useful, have any issues using it, have suggestions for how it could be improved, or have any other feedback, please feel free to reach out to me at hello [at] bensnodin dot com.

I'd be especially interested to hear from you if you're interested in trying out work in nanotechnology strategy research – I’ll likely be happy to help and might have updated notes or other resources.
